[Mobile-First Responsive Design](http://responsivedesign.is/strategy/page-layout/mobile-first)
Mobile-First Responsive Design is a really smart way to approach web development. Mobile is obviously a huge priority, but designing a mobile app can cost triple what a website costs, and it's much harder to update. Mobile-First design allows you to build a website that looks great on a phone so you can still capture mobile users. Once you get certain scale and critical mass, then you can think about a true mobile app.
