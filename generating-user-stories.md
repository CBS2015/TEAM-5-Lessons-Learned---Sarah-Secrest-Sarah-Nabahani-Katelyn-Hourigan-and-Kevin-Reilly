It's very important to identify all of the different use cases of an application or website, so that the software developers know what features and functionalities should be built. When considering use cases, it helps to first identify all the potential end users of the application or website, from segments of consumers to employees. All end users have different needs, and it is important for software developers to understand all of these varying priorities when building code. For instance, a user identified as a "new visitor" to an e-commerce application would want strong discoverability and an ability to quickly see all product offerings; at the same time, a user identified as a "returning visitor" may want to quickly find his/her shopping cart, payment details and the return policy. Once different use cases have been idenitified and the needs mapped out, the easiest way to convey this to software developers is through the Connextra story format. On a series of post-its or cards, the project manager can write out one user story at a time, in the following format: as a (define end user), I want to (define action), so that I can (define result). For example, consider the e-commerce application - as a returning user, I want to see products in my shopping cart so that I can move forward with a purchase. These user stories will ensure that all software developers are on the same page in terms of the features/functionalities; by breaking all the build requirements into individual stories, it can help keep the project moving along by allowing for prioritization and time budgeting. In addition to user stories, job stories are becoming more popular as they add context and causality - when (situation), I want to (motivation) so that I can (outcome).
