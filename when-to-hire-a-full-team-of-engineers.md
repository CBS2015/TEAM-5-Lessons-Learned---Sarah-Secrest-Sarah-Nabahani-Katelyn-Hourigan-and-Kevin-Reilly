One key takeaway that I have from this class is that the first step when you have a business idea is not to hire a team of engineers, contrary to popular belief. You should only hire engineers when you have validated the key assumptions related to your product and determined what the MVP (minimum viable product) is. There are a number of ways you can do this. For example, you can create a landing page that allows people to sign up for your product using Launch Rock. The best way accurately forecast interest in your product is to ask people for their credit card information, which, if given, shows they are truly willing to invest in/ purchase your app or software offering. Software engineers can be costly, as evidenced by the following [data](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Therefore determining what your MVP is before hiring software engineers can save you a lot of money and be beneficial to the long term success of your product. ![Alt Text] (www.http://www.emarketingeye.com/senior-software-engineer-software-engineer-job-code-eme0018.html.gif)
