#What to Look for When Hiring a Software Developer

As an executive in the digital world, you will most likely come across the need to hire a software developer.
As we discussed in the third class, there are several key things to look for, questions to ask, and actions you should take in order to make the best choice possible:

1. Reach out to people you know you can’t hire and have them recommend 2 – 3 people

2. Go to a conference related to your project and ask speakers to recommend people

3. Get references from other developers

4. Get off-book references from clients, past managers and direct reports

5. Ask for previous work examples

6. Ask them to write some example code (try the Fizz Buzz test)

7. Can they bring an “A” team with them?

8. Test their problem solving skills (a key skill for pragmatic programmers)

9. Ask them to explain something technical to see if they can translate programing language into “English” (a great skill for communicating with the business units they will be working with)

10. See if they would be a good culture fit for both the organization and engineers

11. Ask them the number of coding languages they know (should be more than 1)

12. Talk about hobbies or simply look at the person you are interviewing and gauge whether they might have a passion for the product you are ultimately designing for. For example, if it is for shoes, look at their shoes and ask them about their shoe choice. Maybe they like trendy shoes and that is what your end product is.

13. Ask for their [GitHub](www.github.com) profile!

As a final note, something to keep in mind during the hiring process: Managers frequently want to lock in a fixed bid for the work, but oftentimes an hourly bid will more closely align managers and developers and yield the best results overall.
